        Unlike similar apps with the same aim as us we don\'t just
        stop at showing you where filling locations are, we help you to complete the full cycle of a
        plastic bottle, from purchase to re-use to recycling, that means we show you both filling
        stations and recycling bin which no other app currently does.
        \n \n
        Other apps also only let you input locations, we go a little further than that, we allow all
        users to vote on a location, that means if the location was a falls addition or if the
        location closes and subsequently receives more down votes that up votes it will be instantly
        removed from the map leading to less frustration when you really need to refill or dispose
        of you bottles.
